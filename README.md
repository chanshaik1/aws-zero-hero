### What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud").
- It enables users to access and utilize these resources on-demand, rather than maintaining physical hardware or infrastructure locally.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use, reducing upfront costs.
3. **Flexibility:** Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.
4. **Reliability:** Providers often offer high uptime and redundancy.
5. **Security:** Cloud providers invest in robust security measures.

### Types of Cloud Computing

1. **Public Cloud:** Resources are owned and operated by third-party providers, accessible over the internet by the general public.
2. **Private Cloud:** Dedicated resources operated solely for a single organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Types of Cloud Services

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking).

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Software delivered over the internet, typically on a subscription basis.

### What is AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.com. It offers a wide range of services including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more.

### Advantages of AWS

1. **Global Reach:** Extensive global infrastructure with regions and availability zones.
2. **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down.
3. **Cost-Effective:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model reduces upfront costs.
4. **Security:** Strong security measures and compliance certifications.
5. **Innovation:** Continuous updates and introduction of new services.

### Disadvantages of AWS

1. **Complexity:** Vast array of services can lead to complexity in management.
2. **Cost Management:** Potential for costs to escalate without proper monitoring.
3. **Data Transfer Fees:** Charges for data transfer between regions or to the internet.

### AWS Global Infrastructure

#### Regions

AWS Regions are geographical locations where AWS data centers are clustered. Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones.

#### Availability Zones

Availability Zones (AZs) are isolated locations within regions, each containing one or more data centers. They are designed to be independent yet interconnected to provide high availability and fault tolerance.
