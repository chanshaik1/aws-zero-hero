### What is AWS EFS?

**AWS EFS (Elastic File System):** AWS EFS is a scalable, fully managed file storage service that is designed to provide shared access to a file system for multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It is similar to traditional file systems but with the scalability and reliability of AWS cloud services.

### Use Cases of AWS EFS

1. **Content Management:** Storing and sharing content files, documents, and media assets among multiple EC2 instances.
   
2. **Big Data Analytics:** Providing shared access to data files for analytics and processing across multiple instances.

3. **Web Serving:** Hosting web content that needs to be accessed by multiple web servers.

4. **Container Storage:** Storing persistent data for containers managed by Kubernetes or ECS.

5. **Database Backups:** Storing database backups and logs accessible by multiple instances.

### Types of AWS EFS Storage Classes

AWS EFS currently offers two storage classes:

1. **Standard Storage:** This is the default storage class that is suitable for workloads with a broad range of access patterns, including frequently accessed data and larger volumes of data.

2. **Infrequent Access (IA) Storage:** This storage class is optimized for workloads that access data less frequently but require cost-effective storage. It provides a lower price point compared to standard storage, with a retrieval fee when accessing data.

### Lab Session - Creation of AWS EFS

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the AWS EFS Dashboard at [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/).

2. **Create File System:**
   - Click on "Create file system."
   - Choose the appropriate settings, including the VPC and subnets where you want to create the EFS.
   - Optionally configure performance mode and encryption settings.
   - Click "Create file system" to create the EFS.

### Lab Session - Mounting AWS EFS in an EC2 Instance

1. **Install NFS Client on EC2 Instance:**
   - SSH into your EC2 instance.
   - Install NFS client software. For example, on Amazon Linux or CentOS, you can run `sudo yum install -y nfs-utils`.
   
2. **Retrieve File System ID:**
   - Go to the AWS EFS Dashboard.
   - Select your EFS file system and note down the File System ID.

3. **Mount EFS to EC2 Instance:**
   - Create a mount point on your EC2 instance. For example, `sudo mkdir /mnt/efs`.
   - Mount the EFS file system to your instance using the File System ID. For example:
     ```
     sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 <File System ID>:/ /mnt/efs
     ```
   - Replace `<File System ID>` with your actual File System ID.

### Lab Session - Deletion of AWS EFS

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the AWS EFS Dashboard at [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/).

2. **Select EFS File System:**
   - Select the EFS file system you want to delete.

3. **Delete EFS File System:**
   - Click on "Actions" -> "Delete file system."
   - Confirm the deletion when prompted.

### Summary

AWS EFS provides scalable, shared file storage for AWS cloud environments, suitable for a variety of use cases including content management, big data analytics, and container storage. By creating, mounting, and managing EFS file systems, you can efficiently store and share files across multiple EC2 instances while benefiting from AWS's scalability and reliability.
