### What is AWS EBS?

- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
- It provides persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be used for databases, file systems, or any other application requiring durable storage.

### Key Features of AWS EBS

- **Elasticity**: Volumes can be dynamically scaled in size and performance to meet changing application demands.
- **Durability**: Data is automatically replicated within an Availability Zone to protect against component failures.
- **Snapshotting**: Point-in-time snapshots enable backup and recovery of EBS volumes.
- **Encryption**: Volumes can be encrypted using AWS-managed or customer-managed keys for enhanced security.
- **Availability**: Available in all AWS regions, allowing attachment to instances within the same region.

  - Allows users to specify IOPS requirements for their applications.

- **Use Cases:**
  - **Critical Business Applications:** Such as ERP systems, CRM applications that demand high and consistent IOPS.
  - **Big Data Analytics:** Handling large-scale analytics queries and data processing.
  - **High-Performance Databases:** NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra requiring predictable I/O performance.

### 4. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)

- **Description:**
  - Designed for frequently accessed, large, sequential workloads that require high throughput.
  - Cost-effective solution for throughput-intensive applications.

- **Performance:**
  - Provides up to 500 MiB/s throughput.
  - Optimized for scenarios with large, sequential data access patterns.

- **Use Cases:**
  - **Big Data Processing:** Handling large datasets for processing and analytics.
  - **Log Processing:** Continuous data ingestion and processing logs.
  - **Data Warehousing:** Storing and querying large volumes of structured data.

### 5. Cold HDD (sc1)

- **Description:**
  - Designed for infrequently accessed workloads where cost efficiency is paramount.
  - Lower-cost option for data that doesnâ€™t require frequent access.

- **Performance:**
  - Provides up to 250 MiB/s throughput.
  - Suitable for scenarios where storage cost is the primary consideration.

- **Use Cases:**
  - **Infrequent Access Storage:** Storing backups, archives, and disaster recovery data.
  - **Long-term Storage:** Data that is accessed less frequently but needs to be retained.
  - **Cost-Sensitive Workloads:** Where cost efficiency is critical over high performance.

### 6. Magnetic (standard)

- **Description:**
  - Older generation EBS volume type being phased out.
  - Provides the lowest cost per GB among EBS volume types.

- **Performance:**
  - Provides basic, low-performance storage.
  - Suitable for applications with minimal I/O requirements.

- **Use Cases:**
  - **Low I/O Workloads:** Suitable for workloads with minimal I/O operations, such as legacy applications.
  - **Non-Critical Applications:** Development and testing environments where performance is not a primary concern.
  - **Budget-Conscious Environments:** Where minimizing costs is the primary consideration.
